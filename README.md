# Streamline

* This is for Project 2 for UW Extensions Coding Bootcamp.
* It is a website that allows the end user to search for a movie or TV show, whether that be by name or by genre, and see what streaming services the movie or TV show is available on all in one place. No more searching through 5 different streaming service apps to find the show you want to watch! 
* This website is croudsourced. If users don't find a movie or TV show on the app, they can create an account/login and either add a new entry, or edit an existing entry if it is not accurate.
* Images are able to be stored in the database due to the use of Cloudinary.
