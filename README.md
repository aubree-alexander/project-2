#### Development

_streamline_ was developed with today's entertainment consumers in mind.  out of a desire to improve the modern entertainment experience, _streamline_ was developed to create an all-in-one site where consumers can view shows and movies available across multiple streaming services.  as the world moves away from cable and physical media, _streamline_ seeks to be rid of the antiquated practice of channel surfing and creates a space where Users can search for entertainment from all the services they subscribe to.

#### Usage

_streamline_ is a community-maintained database that allows Users to submit entries for their favorite shows and movies, assigning them to the services they are available on along with genres, ratings, and release year.  Users can search the database using multiple paramaters to find media that interests them, as well as what other Users think about it.
